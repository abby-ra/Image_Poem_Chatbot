    "text": "POEM OF THE DAY\nA verdant wall, a wooden frame,\n\nWith leaves of green, a whispered name,\nAn \"M\" in wood, a gentle sign,\nWhere nature's art and comfort twine.\n\n\nA woman sits, serene and calm,\nIn earthy tones, a peaceful balm,\nHer gaze is soft, her spirit free,\nA moment caught, for all to see.\n\n\nDark trousers drape, a graceful fall,\nA lime-green blouse, embracing all,\nHer bare feet rest, upon the floor,\nA simple scene, and nothing more.\n\n\nYet in this scene, a depth resides,\nA quiet strength, that softly glides,\nA tranquil space, a moment shared,\nIn nature's hues, a soul laid bare."
