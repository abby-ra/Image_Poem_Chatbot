    "text": "A blush of pink, a gentle grace,\nUnfurling slow in time and space.\nPetals soft, a silken hue,\nKissed by dawn, with morning dew.\n\nEach layer holds a whispered sigh,\nOf sunlit days and clear blue sky.\nA heart of rose, so sweetly deep,\nWhere secrets bloom and softly sleep.\n\nOn verdant stem, it stands alone,\nA fragile beauty, freshly shown.\nA silent promise, soft and light,\nOf beauty's reign, in purest might.\n"
