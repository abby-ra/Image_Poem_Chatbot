    "text": "Above the world, a fiery crown,\nThe sun descends, a molten down.\nThrough clouds of pearl and amber hue,\nIts golden light breaks, shining through.\n\nA canvas vast, of smoky grace,\nWhere shadows dance in time and space.\nEach fluffy form, a sculpted dream,\nBathed in the sunset's fading gleam.\n\nFrom heights unseen, a tranquil view,\nOf earthly scenes, both old and new.\nA silent hush, a breathless peace,\nAs day surrenders, night's release.\n\nThe sun's embrace, a warm goodbye,\nAs colours bleed across the sky.\nA final blaze, a whispered sigh,\nBefore the stars begin to lie.\n"
